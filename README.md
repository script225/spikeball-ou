# 🏐 OU Roundnet Club

A web app for managing the OU Roundnet (spikeball) club — live ELO rankings, match history, player profiles, badges, and season management.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript |
| Frontend + Backend | Next.js (React + Tailwind CSS + API Routes) |
| Authentication | Clerk |
| Database | Supabase (PostgreSQL) |
| Hosting | Vercel |

> There is no separate backend server. The API lives inside Next.js as API routes under `frontend/app/api/`.

## What's Built So Far

### ✅ Pages

| Page | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Homepage (`/`) | Done | Animated landing page with live leaderboard |
| Sign Up (`/signup`) | Done | Creates a Clerk account + player record, requires email OTP verification |
| Log In (`/login`) | UI done, Clerk not wired | Login form exists but doesn't authenticate yet |
| Player Dashboard (`/dashboard`) | Done | Personalized greeting, live leaderboard with "YOU" badge, ELO explainer, announcements |
| Admin pages | Not started | No UI yet — endpoints exist |
| Player profiles, match history, analytics | Not started | Sidebar links go nowhere |

### ✅ API Endpoints (all live)

## How the ELO System Works

All matches are **2v2**. When an admin approves a match result, the system automatically recalculates ELO for all 4 players.

- **Starting ELO:** 1000
- **Placement phase (first 10 matches):** K-factor = 60 (bigger swings while you're getting ranked)
- **After 10 matches:** K-factor = 24 (smaller, more stable changes)
- ELO is calculated using the average ELO of the opposing team as the reference point
- ELO won't go below 100
- Each season has its own ELO — it resets when a new season starts

---

## Roles

| Role | What they can do |
|---|---|
| **Player** | View leaderboard, their own stats, submit match results |
| **Admin** | Everything above + approve signups, approve/cancel matches, manage seasons, award badges |

Roles are checked server-side on every admin endpoint. If you're not an admin, you get a 403.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project
- A [Clerk](https://clerk.com) app (set one role called `admin` for admins; regular users need no role)

### Run Locally

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Create `frontend/.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

```bash
npm run dev   # http://localhost:3000
```

### Deploy to Vercel

Set Root Directory to `frontend` in Vercel project settings, then add the same 4 env vars above.
